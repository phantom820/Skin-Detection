# Skin-Detection

Image segmentation is the process of isolating certain objects of interests from
a digital image. This means that image segmentation aims to assign labels to
pixels in an image such that pixels with similar characteristics have the same
label. The applications of image segmentation vary from wanting to identify
unique objects in an image, find a particular object or extract certain details
from an image for further exploration. One of the tasks in image segmentation
is skin detection. In the task of skin detection the purpose is to segment object-
s/parts of a colour image that are human skin from those that are not human
skin. Skin detection has several applications such as in medicine to detect body
limbs, gesture detection, pedestrian tracing and facial recognition.
Further implementatio details can be found in the report write up.
